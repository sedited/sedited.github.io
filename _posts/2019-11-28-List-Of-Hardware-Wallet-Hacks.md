title: List of Hardware Wallet Hacks
---

_This is a dynamic document and changes as my understanding of these vulnerabilities changes and as new vulnerabilities get discovered_

What constitutes a hardware wallet hack?<br>
I count anything as a "hack" that allows a hacker to change a hardware wallet's intended behavior. This means it is not relevant to me if the hack was ever exploited, or if it has received a low likelihood rating from vendors.

Know of a hack that is not included?<br>
Let me know here: <https://github.com/sedited/thecharlatan.github.io><br>

:office: Vendor: Coldcard<br>
:scroll: Title: Attack on Coldcard short PINs<br>
:nerd_face: Detail:<br>The attack is achieved by connecting a man-in-the-middle (MITM) to the bus the CCW uses to communicate with its secure element (SE).

:office: Vendor: Ledger<br>
:scroll: Title: OLED screen side-channel vulnerability.<br>
:nerd_face: Detail: A side-channel leakage on the row-based OLED display was found. The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels, allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example, a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover confidential secrets such as the PIN and BIP39 mnemonic. In other words, the side-channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device’s USB connection to make power-consumption measurements and advanced statistical analysis while the secret data is displayed. The side-channel is not relevant in other circumstances, such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data.<br>

:scroll: Title: Unfixable Seed Extraction on Trezor - A practical and reliable attack<br>
:nerd_face: Detail: An attacker with a stolen device can extract the seed from the device. It takes less than 5 minutes and the necessary materials cost around 100$. This vulnerability affects Trezor One, Trezor T, Keepkey and all other Trezor clones. Unfortunately, this vulnerability cannot be patched and, for this reason, we decided not to give technical details about the attack to mitigate a possible exploitation in the field. However SatoshiLabs and Keepkey suggested users to either exclude physical attacks from their threat model, or to use a passphrase.<br>
:eyes: Type: Hardware Exploit<br>
:poop: Bug: Not clear, but seems to be a fundamental bug in the STM32F205 chip. The bug cannot be fixed and the vendors seemed to have changed their threatmodel now to not include localized hardware attacks. Hardware security is only guaranteed with the employment of an additional seed phrase.<br>

:office: Vendor: Ledger<br>
:scroll: Title: Monero private key retrieval.<br>
:nerd_face: Detail: The Monero App for Ledger Nano was found to be vulnerable to a private key retrieval through the use of a malicious Monero Client (desktop application). Some computational elements are encrypted by the Nano S with a key only known to the Monero application, and sent to the desktop client for later use, due to space limitations on the Nano. During the final step of the signature (MLSAG sign), the client sends back some sensitive encrypted elements which the app uses to compute a Schnorr signature. A malicious client can misuse this by replaying earlier elements of this computation, and induce a variant of a nonce-reuse attack (see for example the PS3 Fail). This replay of commands is possible because the key derived by the app to encrypt elements is static, and there is no message authentication.<br>

If the attacker is profit motivated, they can ransom the knowledge of those change UTXO back to you.<br>

The NibbleAndAHalf library is not maintained for security bugs and should not be used by embedded projects where security is important.

:nerd_face: Detail: The monotonic counter limiting the number of attempts to enter the correct password could be bypassed. The monotonic counter of the Secure Chip was still active though, thus limiting the number of available attempts to 730'500 attempts. Assuming a special made device for brute-forcing needs about 10 seconds to guess a password, reaching the upper limit would take approximately 85 days (non-stop). The probability of an attacker guessing, for example, a random 5 character password using lowercase, uppercase and digits is 0.08%, 6 characters is 0.012%, and 7 characters is 0.00002%. The vulnerability was patched with a series of robustness improvements to the firmware and by using the MCU's memory protection unit (MPU).<br>

:nerd_face: Detail: A user has two UTXOs, one with value 15 BTC and hash_prev 1 and another with 20 BTC and hash_prev 2. He now creates a transaction spending 20BTC plus a small fee. For this the malware selects as input 1 the UTXO with hash_prev 1 and a value of 15 BTC and creates a faked input 2 consuming the hash_prev 2 of the UTXO with 20 BTC, but lies about the amount and sets it to 5.00001 BTC. The user confirms the transaction as spending 20 BTC plus 0.00001 BTC fee. The malware then gives an error and asks the user to re-sign the transaction. This time, it creates fake input 1 with hash_prev 1, but fake amount 0.00001 BTC and real input 2 with hash_prev 2 and fake amount 20 BTC. The user again sees that he is spending 20 BTC plus 0.00001 BTC fee and signs the transaction. The malware then takes input 1 of the first transaction and combines it with input 2 of the second transaction. This completes to a valid transaction with valid previous amounts, but with a fee of (20 + 15)-20 = 15 BTC. This extra fee can either be used as a ransom, or to share profit with a miner. The solution to this problem is to validate that the amount of the input transaction is not fraudulent. The only way to achieve this is checking that the transaction committed to in the transaction input actually contains the balance as claimed.<br>
:poop: Bug: Time of check was not time of use for the transaction input balance validation. This disclosure had a wake of controversy, since non transaction index are now left without hardware wallet support.<br>
